    "The stated goal of this project is to correctly predict voting behavior of a member and thought-leader in the Foreign Affairs Committee in the U.S. House of Representative. To do so, I collected every piece of legislation that went before the committee in the past 4 sessions of Congress, and I chose my thought-leader as someone with a long standing record of being on the right side of issues that relate to Latin America. Though this project does not focus solely on legislation that has to do with Latin America, the experiment was designed to predict if the text of a legislation would be supported by someone friendly to the region.\n",
    "\n",
    "After many permutations, I arrived at the conclusion that applying a TF-IDF count vectorizer on the text, upsampling to account for highly imbalanced classes, and using logistic regression, yields a model that does the best results in separating the positive response at a minimum cost of False Positives and computational effort.\n",

    "The project is designed to predict how a long standing member of Congress will vote in future legislation once they retire. As a proof of concept for this aim, I have chosen to analyse the life work of retiring Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen from Miami in the context of the House Foreign Affairs Committee (Committee), specifically regarding bills on Latin America.\n",
    "\n",
    "My original idea was to predict \"favorable\" or \"unfavorable\" legislation toward Latin America, but I realized the subjectivity of every possible metric along partisan lines. However, that didn't disqualify the idea of using the voting record of thought-leaders on the issue as a classifier against which I could design a predictive model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why predict support of a retiring U.S. House member? Congresswoman's Lehtinen's unique life experience and pespective have led her to be on the \"good\" side of every issue related to Latin America. If I can't escape subjectivity when rating legislation, I can model the behavior of someone who for 30 years has been a paragon model to follow. Having been a victim of persecution and dictatorship herself in her native Cuba, she seems to always find the voice of the different affected people of Latin America. Providing a way to machine learn from her legislative experience has value for advocates of the region, and the concept could have application on similar cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using the bills she sponsored in the Committee during the past 4 sessions of Congress, I will create a prediction model that would output a logistic answer to whether Congresswoman Ros-Lehtinen would've voted on a bill given the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "To leverage the text as features, I will perform count vectorizing on the bill text to pick up features. This process will require a lot of critical decision, such as the context lost when lemmitizing count vectorizing results and the choice of stop words in addition to the standards in NLTK's 'english' set. Language that is standard across bills and that make part of the more procedural aspects of bill texts will be incorporated into our stop words threshold when appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting data frame of the count vectorizing will be modeled using random forest, with the intention of using boosting methods if the signal is too weak."

    "\n",
    "From **Sunlight Foundation** I scraped a list of all the bills that were referred to the U.S. House Committee on Foreign Affairs (Committee), from 2009 to the present. In the scrape I kept several variables that helped identify the bill, including potential targets for count vectorizing such as the bill title and nicknames.\n",

    "Using the bill identification information, I built a second scraper that would iterate over the first one for bill information to download the bill text from the **GPO**.\n",

    "Finally, I used the information from Committee specific bills from Sunlight Foundation to parse through **ProPublica's** bill records. From there I scraped which entries in my set Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen has sponsored or cosponsored. I chose sponsorship over votes because those are considerably more common than votes since a small amount of bills introduced ever get vote consideration. It also shows more personal commitment to the language and content of the legislation being proposed.\n",
    "\n",
    "After acquiring the necessary data, the next steps were to prepare them for the count vectorizing. The bills text had a lot of formating to correct whitespaces and select the part of the bill most useful and unique.

    "Given the scope of the project and the data I have collected I have chosen the following features on which to build the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "The main feature(s) is the result of Lemmatized Count Verctorization applied on the corpus of the billtext. The body of text used had been stripped of the preamble of the bill (which includes the sponsors and co-sponsors, as well as the process under which a bill is referred to committee), and of non-word elements such as symbols and section numbering. In addition to the countvectorization, I also used dummy variables to represent what sort of legislation is the entry (HR, HRES, S, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "The response variable is, of course, a metric of Congresswoman Ros-Lehtinen. However, considering how rare is the intersection between bills submitted to the Committee and bills being voted on the floor, I had to use a different parameter. For this reason I chose sponsorship or co-sponsorship of a bill. The number of response classes thus rises to roughly 15% of the data. Using this criteria also prevents me from missing datapoints that occur in the form of voice votes. A voice vote is common in generally agreed legislation and it is incumbent on the opposition party to request the Yays and Nays in order for those vote positions to go into the the federal register.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most aggressive decision I made to address class imbalance was to upsample my positive responses to match my negative responses. I achieved this by resampling with replacement and setting the parameters so the classes were evenly divided at 2150 entries each. After building the models using this data set, I will revert to my original set and run it through the model. The report based on this will be part of my scoring criterion specified above.\n",

Using pairings of Count Vectorizer, and TFIDF Vectorizer, and the models KNeighbors, Logistic Regression, Bernoulli Naive Bayes, Multinomial Naive Bayes, XGBoost, and Random Forest, I looked for the best scoring models possible. Accuracy was always high, but the models kept skewing the results to a very low count of positive predictions, per the confusion matrix and AUC score. \n",
    "\n",
    "After the upsampling described above, the result of my models improved. When I passed the original data in the upsampled-made models, I found that **the best balance of accuracy and computational efficiency was running a logistic regression on TF-IDF Vectorized text.** The results of XGBoost model also showed promise similar to the logistic regression, but not sufficient enough to justify its slow performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final cross-validated accuracy and AUC metric for the chosen logistic regression model were 82% accuracy and .69 for AUC. I am conflicted since this is slightly below my stated goal of reaching .70 AUC score, but with an accuracy well above my original goal, I feel that the proof of concept is achieved and further development with more appropriate Natural Language Processing tools."

    "The task of predicting voting behavior is tricky in parlamentary systems where voting behavior is not always recorded. Moreover, legislation is usually structured in time-honored ways by staffers, thus reducing the impact that text vectorizers will have in predicting the voting member's feelings or style. However, I do believe there is enough of a signal in the analysis of the text that characterizes what sort of legislation they will support.\n",
    "\n",
    "In specific reference to my results and evaluating my experiment, I am a concerned about the low value of recall for the positive responses in my target variable. The model's score of ~.45 for the recall of bill sponsorship does cast a slight shadow over my results and assertions, but I am confident that it is an error other NLP tools will help correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "A subsequent analysis that would deepen the understanding of voting behavior based on legislation text is to run unsupervised learning algorithms, such as LDA. Deploying this project's model and an LDA won't be possible as an integrated system, but it will deepen the subject matter expertise and provide insights for future model development.\n",
